Content: 【2025年最新】Google AI全サービスでEx[1]cel分析を完全攻略 - Gemini・AI Studio・Labs実験ツール総動員の30分ハンズオン｜のむらごろう

The article discusses how to fully master Excel analysis using all Google AI services in 2025, including Gemini, AI St[1]udio, and Labs experimental tools, through a 30-minute hands-on session. It highlights the shift from single AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to integrated AI ecosystems, with Google's compreh[1]ensive AI service group leading the way.

The article covers:
*   **Google AI Ecosystem Overview (2025 Latest Map)**:
    *   **Practical Services (Immediate Im[1]pact)**: Gemini 2.5 Pro, AI Studio, NotebookLM.
    *   **Labs Experimental Services (Next-Generation Experience)**: ImageFX, VideoFX (Flow), MusicFX, Whisk.
*   **Key[1] Differentiators from Other AIs**: Seamless integration across all services, cutting-edge experiences with Lab[1]s experimental tools, cost efficiency through Workspace integration, and high-speed processing via Google Cloud infrastructure.
*   **Preparation Part (Environment Setup)**: Requires a Google account, Google AI Pro/Ultra (recommended for Gemini 2.[1]5 Pro), Google Labs experiment participation, and AI Studio developer access.
*   **Practical Part 1 (Basic Analysis - Gemini 2.5 Pro Centric)**:
    *   **Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Explorator[1]y Analysis with Gemini**: Demonstrates analyzing Excel sales data, calculating basic statistics, checking for missing values, detecting anomalies, and generating SQL for monthly trend visualization.
    *   **Step 2: Custom Analysis Prompt Design with AI Studio**: Shows creating a custom prompt template for Excel ana[1]ysis, focusing on business insights, improvement suggestions, numerical predictions, and optimal graph types.
    *   **Step 3: Insight Extraction and Report Generation with NotebookLM**: Explains integrating Excel with industry [1]reports, generating reliable insights by grounding responses in your material, automatic audio report generation, and expanding to presentation materials.
*   **Practical Part 2 (Labs Experimental Tool Utilization)**:
    *   **Step 4: Data Visualization Revolution with Ima[1]geFX**: Compares traditional methods with ImageFX's ability to generate visuals directly from natural language prompts.
    *   **Step 5: Whisk Utilization Experiment - Visual First Analysis**: Introduces Whisk's approach of using referenc[1]e images instead of text prompts for visual analysis.
    *   **Step 6: Comprehensive Presentation Production with VideoFX and MusicFX (Skipped due to cost)**: Briefly menti[1]ons using VideoFX for video explanations of analysis results and MusicFX for background music.
*   **Practical Part 3 (Integrated Workflow Construction)**:
    *   **Step 7: Seamless Service Integration**: Illustra[1]tes a complete workflow within the Google AI ecosystem, from Excel data to final presentation.
    *   **Step 8: Automation and Scale-up Strategy**: Discusses implementing batch processing for large datasets.
    *[1]   **Step 9: Deliverable Completion and Sharing Strategy**: Outlines the final integrated outputs and sharing stra[1]tegies using Google Workspace.
*   **ROI of Google AI Ecosystem Utilization**: Compares traditional methods with Google AI integrated methods, showing[1] significant time and cost savings, and quality improvement.
*   **Future Evaluation of Experimental Tools**: Predicts the formalization of Labs experimental tools into official se[1]rvices.
*   **Troubleshooting and Limitations**: Addresses common issues like Gemini API rate limits and limitations of Labs ex[1]perimental tools.
*   **Summary**: Emphasizes that the future of AI analysis shifts from single tool performance competition to integrate[1]d ecosystem experience competition.
*   **Appendix**: Provides prompt templates for Gemini Excel analysis, AI Studio custom analysis, and ImageFX visual ge[1]neration.[1]
